The dirtree package provides a macro to typeset directory trees like
in windows explorator.

To install, simply run TeX on dirtree.ins, then move dirtree.sty and
dirtree.tex to somewhere in your TEXINPUTS path.

To obtain documentation, run:
latex dirtree.dtx
makeindex -s gind.ist dirtree
makeindex -s gglo.ist -o dirtree.gls dirtree.glo
latex dirtree.dtx
