\begin{itemize}
\item This installation assumes you are running bash on a Linux machine.

\item There is no need for root access needed for any of these steps.

\item The python modules required for this DRS to run (more up-to-date versions are NOT supported) will make current versions of python not work. It is currently recommended that an isolated version of python be used with this version of the DRS (see Section \ref{section:install-python}).

\item Variables inside \definevariable{ } are defined in Section \ref{section:edit_env_setup} and used throughout to mean ``replace with valued defined in Section \ref{section:edit_env_setup}''.

\item The following denotes a line of text that is to be edited (in a file):

\begin{lstlisting}[style=text]
@VARIABLE_NAME@="Variable Value"
\end{lstlisting}

\item The following denotes a console command to run:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, style=bashstyle]
echo "HelloWorld!"
\end{lstlisting}


\item The following denotes a python command to run:
