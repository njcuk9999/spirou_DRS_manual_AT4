\chapter{Introduction}

This manual describes how to install and run the current version of the spirou DRS (AT-4). The installation process will be simplied in future releases. Some of the chapters give information about indiviudual variables and custom python functions and modules that will not be needed to understand how to run the DRS but are very useful for developmental purposes. Please read the notes below very carefully.

\section{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item This installation assumes you are running \textcolor{red}{bash} on a \textcolor{red}{Linux} machine.

\item There is no need for root access needed for any of these steps.

\item The python modules required for this DRS to run (more up-to-date versions are NOT supported) will make current versions of python not work. It is currently recommended that an isolated version of python be used with this version of the DRS (see Section \ref{section:install-python}).

\item Variables inside \definevariable{ } are defined in Section \ref{section:edit_env_setup} and used throughout to mean ``replace with valued defined in Section \ref{section:edit_env_setup}''.

\item The following denotes a line of text that is to be edited (in a file):

\begin{lstlisting}[style=text]
@VARIABLE_NAME@="Variable Value"
\end{lstlisting}

\item The following denotes a console command to run:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, style=bashstyle]
echo "HelloWorld!"
\end{lstlisting}


\item The following denotes a python command to run:


\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, style=pythonstyle]
>>> print("HelloWorld!")
\end{lstlisting}
